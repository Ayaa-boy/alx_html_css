# TechCon 2024 - Responsive Conference Website

## Project Overview

This project brings to life the homepage for the "TechCon 2024" conference website, meticulously crafted from a professional Figma design. The primary objective is to demonstrate advanced HTML structuring alongside robust CSS techniques to achieve a visually appealing and fully responsive user interface. This webpage is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices, from large desktop monitors to smartphones, leveraging modern CSS methodologies.

## Features

* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
* **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Utilizes modern HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) for clear document outlining and improved accessibility and SEO.
* **Figma-to-Web Fidelity:** Developed with a strong focus on translating a professional design prototype into a high-fidelity web page.
* **Custom Typography:** Incorporates custom fonts (`Source Sans Pro`, `Spin Cycle OT`) to match the design's aesthetic.
* **Vibrant Color Palette:** Implements a design-driven color scheme for visual appeal and brand consistency.
* **Embedded Media:** Showcases the effective use of images for logos, hero sections, speaker profiles, and other visual content.
* **Clear Navigation:** Intuitive navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the page.
* **Interactive Elements:** (To be implemented with CSS, e.g., hover effects, transitions)
* **Accessibility Considerations:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper alt attributes for images and logical content flow.

## Design Reference

This project is built based on the following Figma design:
* [**Page in Figma**](https://www.figma.com/file/yX90W7YjX7z9t45oXWfH0S/TechCon-2024?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=2W7Q7ZzH7Q0Z0D0D-1)
* [**Figma file**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/123456789012345678/TechCon-2024-UI-Design) (Note: You may need to "Duplicate to your Drafts" to fully explore design details.)

**Important Notes for Figma Usage:**
* If your computer doesn't have the specified fonts, you can find them here:
    * [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
    * [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/spin-cycle) (This might require manual installation or using a web font service if available.)
* Some values in Figma are in float (e.g., `16.5px`). Feel free to round these values to the nearest whole number (`17px` or `16px`) when applying CSS.
